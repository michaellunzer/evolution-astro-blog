THURSDAY: CHEST AND BACK  

Workout 1 (Preferably First Thing in the Morning on an Empty Stomach)

- 45 to 60 minutes of low- to medium-intensity cardio. Can be any variant that you like (stairs, treadmill, rower, jogging outside), but you must keep a consistent pace, with your heart rate in the 120-to-130 range.

Workout 2 (Some Other Time During the Day)

- Dynamic Warm-Up

- Do the same workout from week 5, except cut down the rest time to 50 seconds.

- After the workout: Go directly into low- to medium-intensity cardio for at least 20 minutes.
