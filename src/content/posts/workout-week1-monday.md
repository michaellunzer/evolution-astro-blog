WEEK 1: 3-DAY SPLIT: (1) Chest and Back, (2) Legs and Triceps, (3) Shoulders and Biceps---6 Days On, 1 Off 

MONDAY: CHEST AND BACK 

■ Dynamic Warm-Up 

■ Circuit 1: This couplet set is performed with little or no rest between each set until both exercises are completed. In order to perform circuits correctly, progress through all the exercises and then rest. For example, the first set will consist of 20 reps of bench press followed by 20 reps of lat pull-downs, and then you'll rest. After that, you'll do 15 reps of bench press followed by 15 reps of lat pull-downs---and then another period of rest. You'll complete this for all sets of each exercise, rest, and then move on to the next circuit. This is the strategy you'll apply for all circuits, unless instructed otherwise. Barbell Bench Press: sets of 20, 15, 12, 10, 5, 8, and 16 reps; weight will be moderate, so that you can get all of the reps with good form. Lat Pull-Down with Wide Pronated Grip: sets of 20, 15, 12, 10, 5, 8, and 16 reps; weight will be moderate, so that you can get all of the reps with good form. Rest 1 minute and then repeat circuit, performing a total of 7 sets each of bench press and lat pull-downs. 

■ Circuit 2: This couplet set is performed with little or no rest between each set until both exercises are completed. Dumbbell Incline Press: 12 to 15 reps; weight will be light to moderate, so that you can get all of the reps with good form and a good isometric contraction at the peak. One-Arm Dumbbell Row with Neutral Grip: 10 to 12 reps each arm. Rest 1 minute and then repeat circuit. Do this 4 times. Push yourself to stay at the same weight, or slightly increase the weight on each set. 

■ Circuit 3: This couplet set is performed with little or no rest between each set until both exercises are completed. Pec Deck: 10 reps; weight will be moderate, so that you can get all of the reps with good form. Low Row with Narrow Neutral Grip: 10 reps; weight will be moderate, so that you can get all of the reps with good form. Rest 1 minute and then repeat circuit. Do this 4 times. Push yourself to stay at the same weight, or slightly increase the weight on each set.
