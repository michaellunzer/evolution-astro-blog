WEDNESDAY: DELTOIDS AND BICEPS

- Dynamic Warm-Up

- Circuit 1: This triplet set is performed with little or no rest between each set until all three exercises are completed.

  Standing Military Press: 10 reps; weight will be moderate, so that you can get all of the reps with good form.

  (Light) Standing Military Press: 12 reps; drop the weight from the first set by 40 percent. Try to have the barbell set up so that you can pause only long enough to strip the desired weight off each end of the bar and then get back in it. This should take only 10 to 15 seconds.

  Standing Barbell Curl: 10 to 12 reps; use the same bar and either use the same weight as the last Military Press or add a little more. Make this transition fast! Under 20 seconds.

  Rest 1 minute and then repeat circuit. Do this 4 times. Push yourself to stay at the same weight, or slightly increase the weight on each set.

- Circuit 2: This couplet set is performed with little or no rest between each set until both exercises are completed.

  Cable One-Arm Lateral Raise: 12 to 15 reps; weight will be light to moderate, so that you can get all of the reps with good form and a good isometric contraction at the peak.

  Dumbbell Alternating Curl with Twist: 20 reps, 10 each arm.

  Rest 1 minute and then repeat circuit. Do this 4 times. Push yourself to stay at the same weight.

- Circuit 3: This triplet set is performed with little or no rest between each set until all three exercises are completed.

  Dumbbell Front Raise: 10 reps; weight will be light, so that you can get all of the reps with good form.

  Dumbbell Rear-Deltoid Raise: use the same dumbbells from the Front Raise; go right into it.

  Rope Hammer Curl (drop set): 10 reps; drop the weight and do 10 more.

  Rest 1 minute and then repeat circuit. Do this 4 times. Push yourself to stay at the same weight.

- After the workout: Go directly into low- to medium-intensity cardio for at least 20 minutes.
